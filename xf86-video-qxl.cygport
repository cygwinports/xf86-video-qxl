SUMMARY="Xorg Spice server driver"
DESCRIPTION="Xspice is an X server and Spice server in one. It consists of a
wrapper script for executing Xorg with the right parameters and environment
variables, a module implementing three drivers: a video mostly code identical
to the guest qxl X driver, and keyboard and mouse reading from the Spice inputs
channel. Xspice allows regular X connections, while a spice client provides the
keyboard and mouse and video output."
